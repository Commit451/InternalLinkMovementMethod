# Lift
Simple Android Application update logic component

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/Lift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/Lift) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Commit451/Lift.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Commit451/Lift)

# About
When upgrading a database, you get callbacks such as `onUpgrade(oldVersion, newVersion)`. But, these are only useful and usable when you are dealing with database migrations. What about when you need to upgrade `SharedPreferences`, switch from SQLite to Realm, etc? Lift aims to fill those gaps and allow an upgrade path for any possible app version upgrade you might need, making use of the apps version code provided in the `build.gradle`.

# Usage

```java
//Within Application.onCreate()
Lift.check(this, new Lift.Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        if (oldVersion == 100 && newVersion == 101) {
            prefs.clear();
            MigrationUtil.migrateToRealm();
            //etc.
        }
    }
});
```
Even if you do not have a needed upgrade right away, you should add the `check` and callback to your app so that it starts tracking the current version of the app for when you do eventually want to provide an upgrade. 

# Auto Backup
If you are using [auto backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html), you will want to add rules for Lift. See the sample project for a full example, but it should look like this:

Change your manifest to `android:fullBackupContent="@xml/my_backup_rules"`

And your `my_backup_rules` should look like:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<full-backup-content>
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="lift.xml"/>
</full-backup-content>

```

# Note
Due to the way that the version is stored in `SharedPreferences`, if you are adding Lift to an existing app, it will get the first call to `onUpgrade` where the `oldVersion` value is equal to `VERSION_NOT_STORED` (-1).
